Developed a BigInt class in C++ to handle arbitrarily large integers beyond standard data types, leveraging OOP principles such as constructors, operator overloading, and arithmetic operations.
Implemented advanced algorithms, including divide-and-conquer multiplication, efficient division, and optimized exponentiation, to perform computations on large integers efficiently.
